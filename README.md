# Airgead Banking Investment Calculator

This project was about making an investment calculator for Airgead Banking to help high school students learn how saving and compound interest work. It lets them see how their money grows over time, with or without adding extra each month.

## What I Did Well

I did basic input verification pretty well. There is room for improvement—I forgot to check for character input vs. number.

## What I Would Improve

I would try to break the code up into more functions. An example I can see now is to make the display output into a separate function instead of having the same few lines of code in each output function—just have a function recall. This would make the code more efficient and easier to make changes to in the future. Also, by having it easier to make changes, it will be easier to find and fix security issues because I wouldn't have to make the changes to every function, just the one the issue is in.

## Challenges

The most challenging part of the code to write was the output screen. I had trouble getting things to line up and to look nice.

## Maintainability

I tried to make the program maintainable by keeping things organized and readable. I used a class to keep the logic in one place, and I used consistent formatting and comments so it’s easier to follow. If I wanted to make changes later—like updating how the output looks—I could do that without digging through the whole program.
